# Cairns

From the moment we stepped off the plane in Cairns around 5 AM, we knew this would be different from Japan.

We went from rainy days to sunny, tropical heat. From Japan's amazing, fast public transport to using Uber because there is no public transport at the airport. The reserved, quiet Japanese culture shifted to the friendly, talkative Australians. And finally, our way of travelling changed from being a tourist who tries to visit everything to living and working with an Australian family. So yeah, it is a new adventure and it started right away.

After arriving at our new home for the upcoming days at 6:30 in the morning, we took a short but much-needed nap. Later, we drove to the family’s children's school. This family has five children between 6 and 11 years old, so there is always something happening. For Halloween, they organized an event where the kids dressed up and went trick-or-treating at a retirement home. Pure chaos but so cute to see all the kids connect with the elderly. After that, we went to a Halloween event in a DIY store. Yes, you read that right! Imagine going to the Brico on a Thursday evening and getting free food, drinks and entertainment. We also learned that the store frequently organizes such events during weekdays to be creative with plants and other things for the children. Not a bad idea at all, because the parents can go shopping in the meantime. To close off the first evening, we drove around the neighbourhood, went trick-or-treating, and saw some wonderfully decorated houses. I would call that a packed but perfect first day!

The next few days were dedicated to helping the family and adjusting to the new country. It is nice to stay with an Aussie family for a longer period and enjoy home-cooked meals. It feels a bit like a home away from home, except that the house is larger and much more crowded. Living with five small kids makes mornings and evenings a little hectic, which is only natural. We help clean the house and garden as much as possible.

Gardening in Australia is different from in Belgium. The grass is thicker and stronger, and the trees are tropical. When we burned all the leaves and old coconuts, it created a more tropical-smelling smoke. While working in the garden some animals came to say hello. Australia is known for its spiders and snakes, so Delphine stayed vigilant. But so far we are really surprised, we’ve encountered more big spiders in Japan than here in Australia. We’ll see what the future brings. We did see a stick insect, little jumpy spiders, toads, cockroaches, mini scorpions, many butterflies, grasshoppers, lizards, and lots of ants! Big green ants that taste like lemon (they say but we didn’t try them yet) and tiny sugar ants which appear within seconds whenever there’s food to be found.

After getting a bit used to the heat, we took the time to enjoy the tropical scenery beyond the garden. Even though winter just ended, it is already 30 degrees, can’t imagine what summer must feel like! Naturally, we went to see the sunrise on the beach from under a palm tree on Trinity Beach before exploring more. Palm Cove, the last beach we visited, is apparently nominated to be the world’s best beach of 2024! Things we’ve noticed so far are: that there is a small amount of sand on the beach (compared to Belgium) and palm trees separate the beach from the cosy restaurants, cafes and hotels. Unfortunately, we didn’t spot any dolphins, but we did see white parrots and two startled Wallabies.

Since it had been quite some time we did a proper hike, we were ready to get our calves burning again. We asked our family which hiking trails were worth doing and set our minds to tackle Saddle Mountain and explore the rainforest. To ensure we could complete the entire hike without needing shortcuts, we started early in the morning when the temperature was more bearable. At least that’s what we hoped for. Getting up a mountain at 29 degrees was a bit harder than expected. Luckily we both had a small bottle of water in our backpack. Along the way, we walked past a lizard climbing a tree. When we reached the top, we enjoyed the views of Kewarra and the sea and on top of that a breeze of air. We were able to complete the whole trail and jumped in the pool afterwards to cool off and prepare for the remaining tasks of the day.

Following our host family’s advice, we travelled to Cairns City to visit Rusty’s Market. Just before catching the bus to Cairns City, we made a quick stop to perform some wallaby spotting and with great success this time! We found heaps of them searching for a cool spot in the shadows of the trees. We tried to get as close as possible without scaring them away and take a picture. After that, we continued to the covered local market with mostly (tropical) fruit and vegetables. We decided to buy a mix of fruits that we hadn’t tried before, along with some safe options just in case. We ended up with a fruit salad containing: dragon fruit, local mango, papaya, sweet pineapple, jackfruit and mangosteen. Having tried the different fruits we concluded that the tropical fruits we’d bought had amazing looks but not that much taste. Putting them in a blender and making a smoothie was the way to go! We also bought black sapote which is a fruit that should have like a chocolate pudding inside. Eager to try it out but it isn’t ripe yet, so we will keep you posted.

This was our first Workaway experience, and we’re looking forward to many more. We enjoy helping local people and getting to know the way they live. This being said it is not always a piece of cake. They live their way and with their own rules. On top of that there are the cultural differences and, in this case, five young children! You have to adapt to their way of living. Anyone who knows us can imagine that Arnaud adjusts well, while Delphine needs a little more time to adjust.
