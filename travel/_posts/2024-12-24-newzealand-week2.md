# Queenstown - Fox Glacier - Greymouth - Nelson

With our feet dry in our Crocs, we arrived in Queenstown, prepared our sleeping pod for the night, and got ready to explore the city after a long drive. From the moment you step into Queenstown, you can feel its vibrant atmosphere. DJs were playing at the bars, and a skate ramp had been set up on a bar’s terrace, with a lively crowd cheering on someone attempting it for the first time. We walked around the harbour and were right on time to catch the sunset over the lake, framed by the majestic mountains.

The next day, we chilled for a bit and got ready for our next adventure: the Nevis Swing. Allegedly the most famous swing in the world, but with an amazing drop of 300 meters in the Nevis Valley it’s one hell of an experience. We were both excited to get to the platform and smile a last time before the unexpected drop. Too bad it’s over in a couple of seconds, but the adrenaline rush is incredible. To get there, we hopped on a four-wheel drive truck, converted to a bus, and drove up a narrow path to the mountain. Funny enough, the bus ride felt even more nerve-wracking than the swing itself.

We continued exploring Queenstown; trying out the country’s most famous burger place and having some delicious ice cream. The burgers were tasty, but Levi’s Burgers remains the number one. The ice cream, however, absolutely lived up to the hype, with too many flavours to choose from and real Belgian chocolate in the mix.

After seeing snow at Lake Tekapo earlier in the trip, we didn’t have any other choice than to drive to the Alps of New Zealand to get a closer look at those snowy mountain tops. As a snow lover, Arnaud wanted to touch the mountain snow. So off we went to Fox Glacier, a village near the famous Fox and Franz Josef glaciers, surrounded by breathtaking walking trails. Most were one-way tracks, but still stunning.

After searching and debating which trail would be doable, dry, and scenic, we decided to try Alex knob. This trail is approximately 17 km long and 1,000 meters high. We started early, navigating a sometimes technical path through the green rainforest. Along the way, we were rewarded with open skyline views and multiple glimpses of the glacier. Even though we started early, we didn’t have the view we hoped for. When we reached the top at noon, the clouds already settled in and blocked our view. Taking some time to recover (especially Delphine could use a break), we were rewarded with some small clear views of the snowy mountaintops. Still craving more glacier experiences, we stopped at a famous viewpoint and did a shorter walk the next day. Sadly, touching the ice itself was only possible via helicopter tours, which we skipped.

Proceeding our trip around the southern island, we drove further north along the coast. Along the way, we stopped at some nice places. Our first stop was Hokitika Gorge, where we found crystal-clear, ice-cold blue water surrounded by white rocks. It's the perfect place for a swim on a hot day or for ice bath lovers. Next, to strengthen our knowledge about the mine history in New Zealand, we visited the Brunner Mine site. The mining industry was an important part of New Zealand’s economy. A lot of British families came to New Zealand to work in the mines in very bad conditions. The mine experienced the biggest mine disaster in New Zealand in 1896 when an explosion in the tunnels took many lives.
Further north, you have the Pancake Rocks. An amazing natural phenomenon where mud and sediment transformed into rock over thousands of years. Looking at the rocks, we were surprised by some little dolphins swimming by. The first time we saw dolphins in the wild! Not just any dolphins but the smallest and rarest dolphin, Hector’s dolphins, also known as "Mickey Mouse dolphins" because of the ear-shaped fin on their backs. Not far from the Pancake Rocks is a small cave you can explore by yourself. Arnaud was a little hesitant to go through the small dark bits because of a fear of small places but it was totally worth it. Far above us, two little glow worms nestled in the cave. A little creepy because once we turned off the torch it was pitch black and it kind of looked like a pair of eyes looking at us.

Our final stop on the South Island was Nelson. A friendly Kiwi generously hosted us in their beautiful home just outside the city centre. Listening to all his recommendations for activities in the area, we decided again to go on a walk. This time a coastal walk, one way of course. We decided to head back in the middle of the walk. The idea of walking for 3 hours along the coast and having to go back on the same road made us lose motivation. The fact that it was raining again didn’t help either. So we enjoyed a hot chocolate to warm up before heading to the centre of Nelson. There was a small piece of heaven for Arnaud, the Classic Car Museum. As happy as a small kid, he walked around and took some photos in the cars. As a cherry on top, there was a DeLorean where you were allowed to sit in and take photos.

To wrap up our stay on the South Island, we cooked dinner for our host and learned a new card game. It is so nice to have some normal everyday moments when you are travelling. It is an amazing experience to be able to do this trip. We already did and saw some amazing things. Nevertheless, nothing is always perfect. Getting news from home that loved ones passed away and we aren’t able to be there to support the people around us is hard. It teaches us to be thankful for this experience and the technology nowadays. Being far away doesn’t always feel that far.

Last but not least, have a wonderful Christmas y’all!
