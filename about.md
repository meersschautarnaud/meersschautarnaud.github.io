Hi!

I'm Arnaud Meersschaut, a tech enthousiast and currently working as a consultant at [codit](www.codit.eu), where I started in 2018. I strongly believe that via technology we can improve our daily live and make things easier.

As you will read on the travel part of this website, I'm a huge fan of traveling, discovering wonderful places and meeting new people to experience different cultures. By traveling I mean, preferably with a backpack and detached from the online world we live in these days. Back to the basics and mostly away of the luxury we are used to (sometimes a bit of luxury can be appreciated).

Happy reading!
